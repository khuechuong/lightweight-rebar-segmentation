# Lightweight Rebar Segmentation

This code is based on [Image Segmentation Keras](https://github.com/divamgupta/image-segmentation-keras), but is heavily modified although **the instructions to run it should be the same**.

This network uses a small number of parameters, is time efficient, and has higher accuracy than other architecture.
